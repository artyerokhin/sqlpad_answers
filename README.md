# Main information
This repository contains solutions for SQL tasks from sqlpad.io 
There are only solutions to tasks, but not the tasks themselves. In order to see them, go to the page above.
All solutions are just for informational purposes. Please do not use it for cheating. Only if you stuck and you need advice or some help to figure it out. 

# Sturcture
There are 3 big task chapters:
- SINGLE TABLE OPERATIONS
- MULTI-TABLE OPERATIONS
- WINDOW FUNCTIONS

Solutions are in three folders with named accordingly. One task per file. Name of .sql files are the same as tasks (for instance Percentage of revenue per movie.sql is for "Percentage of revenue per movie" task)

# Additional information
Course was finished in March 2021 (**third place** at monthly leaderboard). So, it is possible that some tasks will change in future.
